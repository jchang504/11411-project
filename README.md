# 11-411 Project: Wikipedia Article Q&A System

This was Team Hydra's semester project for 11-411 Natural Language Processing
at Carnegie Mellon University. [This
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujsDOPfgnbk) succinctly explains what
the project was about and what we did.

Somehow, we won 3rd place (of 17) in the question-asking aspect of the
competition!

## Status

It is in the sort of state that you might expect after starting with a simple
prototype, simmering ideas on the back burner (AKA procrastinating) for several
months, then rewriting the whole thing in essentially a 3-day hackathon before
the final deadline. I wouldn't recommend trying to run it, though the code
should be sufficiently self-documenting to allow a determined user to figure
out the Python module and Stanford NLP tool dependencies and command line args.

It is not (and probably will not ever be) maintained. The code is rather a
mess. But I did learn a ton from working on this project, and might try my hand
at a more mature implementation of this sort of application in the future.
