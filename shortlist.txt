DONE wh-question generation
DONE Limit sentence length to prevent memory explosion
DONE wh-question answering
- binary question answering
- aesthetics
- Stanford parser's raw_parse_sents returns iter(iter(Tree)) with older Stanford; need to convert to list and remove extra [] around each Tree
- Stanford NER puts extra list ([]) around tags on GHC
- Infinite loop in get_noun if no noun child, etc.
- General robustness everywhere, e.g. get_inflection
